# Launchframe

1. `git clone` this project
1. `cd launchframe` and then `rm -rf .git*` unless you are working on Launchframe itself.
1. `npm install`
1. `bower install`
1. `gulp watch`
1. Note that these steps are also completed by running `bin/setup`
1. In future work sessions, to get up and running quickly, use `bin/session` - note, however, that this command assumes you will be working with tmux and vim

## Some features you should know about:

- Launchframe uses [http://bourbon.io/docs](Bourbon) and [Neat](http://thoughtbot.github.io/neat-docs/latest)
- Launchframe comes with jQuery already registered via the `functions.php` file
- Launchframe's Gulp-powered workflow now includes Babel so that you're ES6 backflips can be landed gracefully

## Other notes
- Launchframe does not include a bootstrapping tool to start a new Wordpress project currently, so this should be treated solely as a theme
